Set up two small (50ms?) sample buffers for SharpDX output, keep streams open for writing
Queue buffers for play in SharpDX

Repeat {

	Until buffer length >= configured length {
		Read current tickstep sample length
		Determine commands for given tick {
			if command row this tick {
				...
			}
			else process commands for multi-tick command codes (arps etc.)
		}
		Assemble command buffers, insert into patchboard "input headers"
		Run plugins for the tick's sample length, bucket by bucket
		Collect all output headings into 
		Add mixed tick output buffer to rolling buffer
		Sleep(0)?
	}
	(Start playing here if only now beginning playback)
	If buffers queued < 2, pull playbuffer length from rolling buffer into unqueued playbuffer and requeue
